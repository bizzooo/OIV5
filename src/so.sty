so
U have thing called presudo elements
::after
::before
only elements with open and close tag
can have it like <div> </div> after or before
defines whether to put it before content or after
content, u cannot use them for <input /> or <br /> or anzthing with /> at the end

u cannot put any html inside of it 
only plain text content insdie of content:"", as u have seen u should have it
anyway even if u leave it empty for element to show up

u could use just any element within some parent and set parent position to relative
and child position to absolute with same effect

basic structure is lie :
parent{
    position: relative;
}
child{
    position: absolute;
    width: // u must have width both usualy 100% of parent (depends)
    heigh: // u must have height
    top: // usualy 0 (desired distance from top)
    left: // guess what :)
}

yep so that way position and behaviour of child element binded to parent 

thansk man that was really useful less confusing about relative absolute :)

I want to use regular css bcuz the guy at the job uses regular css

im sorry for u :((
thats a prep or the test
not really I just want to revise since i will be doing it
also naloga 5 for oiv
oh okay 


i mean its in russian but u can 2x it and just look in code, he does BEM with SCSS but its no different from css
BEM is naming convention for classes 
u call every parent element of sense anything and every child as 

u would have smth like
.button
.button__icon
thats bem

should we pay attention ? 
He explains REST 



no 
not really

but yeah im trying to get this design 

if u want to build that thing u should think from the bigest element to smallest
not like from left to right
where is it 
here u can clealry see u have some modal
some div in the center
then create this div with width 600px and put it to center of the screen 
thats step 1
then u see its slpitted in half
so do either grid or flex with flex:1 1 50% for both child to make them take equal half
after that go check the layout 


first thing main container


then look on spli
one div
and another
thats a div nesting structure 


thats a component 
same one with parameter for this after element position
either left or right

start from start 
not from the middle 


prepare css variables for colors 
for fonts
for h1 h2 h3 etc. 

Do I also download 

Btw you wanna go to the library after class ?
